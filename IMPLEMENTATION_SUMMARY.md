## üêõ Bug Fixes

### 1. Timer Running Across Tabs ‚úÖ
**Problem**: Timer would stop when switching tabs or minimizing the window.

**Solution**: Changed from interval-based counter to timestamp-based calculation.

**Implementation**:
- Added `TimerState` interface with `startTime` and `pausedTime`
- Timer now stores start time (`Date.now()`) when task begins
- Elapsed time is calculated on each interval: `(Date.now() - startTime) - pausedTime`
- Works seamlessly even when switching tabs or minimizing!

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/store/useStore.ts` - Added timer state management
- `frontend/src/components/Dashboard.tsx` - Updated timer calculation logic

## ‚ú® Improvements

### 2. AI Updates Both Title AND Description ‚úÖ
**Feature**: When creating a task, AI now enhances BOTH the title and description.

**Implementation**:
- Added `generate_enhanced_description()` function to Ollama client
- Created new `/ai/enhance-task` endpoint that returns both title and description
- AI generates professional, context-rich descriptions from user input

**Example**:
- User Input: `"working on login page"`
- AI Title: `"Design New Login Page"`
- AI Description: `"Designing and implementing the new login page interface with improved UX and security features."`

**Files Modified**:
- `backend/utils/ollama_client.py` - Added `generate_enhanced_description()`
- `backend/routes/ai.py` - Added `/ai/enhance-task` endpoint

### 3. Summarize Button in Timeline ‚úÖ
**Feature**: AI-powered work summary generation with a single click.

**Implementation**:
- Added "Summarize" button in Activity Timeline header
- Button appears only when tasks exist
- Opens elegant dialog with AI-generated summary
- Uses completed tasks to generate 2-3 sentence professional summary

**User Experience**:
1. User clicks "Summarize" button
2. Dialog opens with loading state
3. AI analyzes all completed tasks
4. Returns concise summary like: _"Today you focused on development tasks, spending 2.5 hours on the login page implementation and 1 hour on bug fixes. You also attended a 30-minute team planning meeting."_

**Files Modified**:
- `frontend/src/components/ActivityTimeline.tsx` - Added button, dialog, and handler

User: "What should I focus on next?"
AI: "Based on your recent pattern, you tend to be most productive in the morning. Consider tackling complex tasks like the payment system bugs during that time."

User: "Show me my top task types"
AI: "Your work breakdown shows 60% development tasks, 25% meetings, and 15% learning. You're spending good time on hands-on coding!"
```

#### Chat Context Includes
- Today's task count and total time
