## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Windows SmartScreen Warning

```
"Windows protected your PC"
```

**This is NORMAL** for unsigned apps. Users can click:
1. "More info"
2. "Run anyway"

**To Fix (Optional):**
- Get a code-signing certificate (~$100-500/year)
- Sign the executable before distributing
- Windows will trust it immediately

### Firewall Prompts
Users may see a firewall prompt for the FastAPI backend (port 8000).
- This is normal
- Click "Allow access"
